Notes:

- Most runtime coverage remains in `apps/favn_legacy/test` until slices are migrated.
- Each migrated slice must move or recreate tests in the new owner app without dual-compiling namespace owners.
- During Phase 2, umbrella `mix test` runs migrated owner-app suites first; legacy runtime suites remain available in `apps/favn_legacy/test` as reference coverage.
- The current umbrella `mix test` alias shape is migration-oriented and not the final CI/test contract.
- Test execution should be simplified again after ownership and runtime boundaries settle in later phases.
- `apps/favn_test_support` is the shared home for cross-app fixtures, helpers, builders, and file fixtures used during migration.
- Umbrella apps may depend on `favn_test_support` only with `only: :test`.
- Fixtures used by only one app should stay in that app's local `test/support` directory.
- Phase 3 should grow `apps/favn_core/test` with manifest schema, manifest versioning, serializer, compatibility, graph, and shared contract tests.
- `apps/favn/test` should stay focused on public DSL/facade coverage once internal compiler/manifest tests move down into `favn_core`.
- Initial Phase 3 tests now exist under `apps/favn_core/test/manifest/` and `apps/favn_core/test/contracts/`.
- `apps/favn_core/test/manifest/` now includes `build_test.exs` and `graph_test.exs` in addition to serializer/version/identity/compatibility coverage.
- `apps/favn_core/test/contracts/contract_lock_test.exs` now locks runner contract key shapes before Phase 4 runner work.
- Boundary-leak cleanup coverage now includes `apps/favn_core/test/boundary_explicit_inputs_test.exs` and `apps/favn/test/boundary_defaults_test.exs`.
- Phase 4 grew `apps/favn_runner/test/` around manifest registration, manifest resolution, worker execution, connection runtime ownership, SQL asset execution, and same-node runner integration.
- Phase 4 also added `apps/favn_core/test/run/` for the shared `Favn.Run.Context` and `Favn.Run.AssetResult` contracts after moving them out of legacy.
- Initial Phase 4 tests now include:
  - `apps/favn_core/test/run/context_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_core/test/run/asset_result_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_runner/test/manifest_store_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_runner/test/manifest_resolver_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_runner/test/server_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_runner/test/worker_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_runner/test/execution/sql_asset_test.exs`
  - `apps/favn_runner/test/favn_runner_test.exs` for same-node manifest registration + runner execution flow
